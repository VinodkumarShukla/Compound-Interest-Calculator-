# Compound-Interest-Calculator-

Description:
The Compound Interest Calculator is a Python program that helps users understand the power of compound interest and plan their savings by calculating the future value of their investments. Compound interest is a financial concept that demonstrates the benefits of saving early and consistently. This program takes user input for key variables such as the initial investment amount (P), interest rate (r), number of compoundings per year (n), and the number of years (t) for which the interest will be calculated.

The program calculates the new balance of the account (P') after earning interest for a specified number of years. It uses the compound interest formula:

P' = P * (1 + (r / n))^(n * t)

Key Features:

User Input: The program prompts the user to input the initial investment amount (P), the annual interest rate (r), the number of compoundings per year (n), and the number of years (t) for which they want to calculate interest.
Compound Interest Calculation: The program uses the provided input to calculate the future value of the investment using the compound interest formula.
Results Display: After performing the calculations, the program displays the new account balance (P') along with a breakdown of the interest earned over the specified period.
Educational Tool: This program serves as an educational tool to help users understand the significance of compound interest and the importance of long-term savings.
